# Security Policy 🛡️

## Supported Versions
We actively maintain and patch the **latest main branch**. Anything older may still work, but think of it as *unsupported vintage software* — like running a firewall on a Nokia 3310.  

| Version | Supported |
|---------|------------|
| Main branch | ✅ Supported |
| Old releases | ❌ Unsupported (at your own peril) |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use **[GitHub Private Security Advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/about-coordinated-disclosure-of-security-vulnerabilities)** to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.  

We do **not** accept disclosures via:  
- Email (too risky, too spammy)  
- Slack DMs (they get lost between memes)  
- Sticky notes left on keyboards  

---

## What to Include
When submitting an advisory, please provide:  
- Steps to reproduce (bonus points if they’re entertaining).  
- Expected vs. actual behavior (preferably without invoking eldritch horrors).  
- Impact assessment (how badly things break).  

---

## Response Times
- Acknowledgement: within **72 hours** (unless our CI/CD pipeline has summoned a demon).  
- Initial assessment: within **7 days**.  
- Patch timeline: depends on caffeine intake and meeting schedules.  

---

## Alternative (Unofficial) Channels ☕
If Private Security Advisories somehow fail, you may also attempt:  
- Carrier pigeon 🐦 (delivery SLA: 3–5 business days, weather permitting).  
- Smoke signals 🔥 (we monitor skies between 09:00–17:00 UTC).  
- Morse code tapped on the office coffee machine.  
- Summoning ritual involving YAML, goat sacrifices, and three Jira tickets.

## Our Promise
We will:  
- Thank you sincerely.  
- Fix it (without calling it a “feature”).  
- Credit you in release notes (unless you prefer to remain an unsung hero).  

We won’t:  
- Ask if you tried turning it off and on again.  
- Pay bug bounties in expired coffee coupons.  
- Pretend it’s fine until Reddit finds out.
