# Repository Audit Scripts ðŸš€

Welcome to the **Repository Audit Scripts** suite! This collection of tools helps automate evaluation and auditing of various components in software development, including GitHub repositories, Docker images, and NPM packages.

## Why These Scripts? ðŸ¤”

Letâ€™s face it: manual auditing is tedious and error-prone. These scripts help automate checks for best practices, license presence, last activity, security policies, and more. Whether you're doing compliance, security, or general code hygiene checks, these tools make it easier and faster.

### `githubaudit.py`
- **Repository Info:** Get detailed information about the repository, including its license and primary language.
- **Security Policy Check:** Verifies the existence of a security policy.
- **Activity Audit:** Checks the latest commit date to assess project activity.
- **License Audit:** Verifies whether a license file is present.

### `dockeraudit.py`
- **Dockerfile Linter:** Scans Dockerfiles for common security and style issues.
- **Best Practices Check:** Highlights risky instructions and deprecated syntax.
- **Output Summary:** Presents a summary of key issues to fix.

### `npmaudit.py`
- **Package Vulnerability Scan:** Checks `package.json` and `package-lock.json` for known vulnerabilities.
